Wordpress on Rocky Linux
- set up vm, following same steps as lecture but choose rocky linux as VM under boot disk
- sudo dnf upgrade - upgrade machine - rocky linux uses dnf as opposed to apt. 
I also ran into an issue in my first attempt where I had to create another instance 
with more RAM to run this. Also ran into issues with 2GB VM during mysql install.
- sudo dnf install httpd
- sudo systemctl enable httpd + sudo systemctl start httpd
-sudo dnf install all the php modules (I believe this is where I actually ran into errors on my first try. 
I got through almost everything without any apparent issues, but when it came to visiting the wordpress link there were similar 
errors to your video and it turns out I didn't have all the necessary php modules)
- navigate to /var/www/html and create info.php file (sudo nano info.php)
- in /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf, add index.php to DirectoryIndex list
- Add browser detector file to index.php
-sudo systemctl reload/restart httpd
-sudo dnf install mysql-server mysql-common
-sytemctl status mysqld
-sudo systemctl enable/start mysqld
-sudo mysql_secure_installation
-mysql -u root -p to login to mysql
-create user ‘wordpress’@’localhost’ identified by ‘1717’;
-create database wordpress;
-grant all privileges on wordpress.* to ‘wordpress’@’localhost’;
-sudo curl wordpress files
-sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
-sudo cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
-sudo nano wp-config.php
-Update database name, username, password
